## EXIT PROTOCOL (MANDATORY — applies to every Ralph loop)

### Per-Task Completion

A task is DONE when ALL of these pass. Do not skip any.

1. Every acceptance criteria checkbox in MASTER_TODO.md is satisfied
2. Every validation command listed for the task exits with code 0
3. `npx tsc --noEmit` passes (zero TypeScript errors)
4. Task status updated to `[x]` in MASTER_TODO.md
5. Git commit created: `feat(epic-N): task N.M — [short description]`
6. If the task creates a UI component, a co-located `.stories.tsx` file exists and compiles

### Per-Task Failure (3-strike rule)

If a task fails validation:
1. First attempt: diagnose root cause, fix, re-validate
2. Second attempt: try alternative approach, re-validate
3. Third attempt: mark task `[!]` with reason, move to next task
4. Do NOT loop endlessly — 3 attempts max per task

### Per-Epic Completion

When ALL tasks in the epic are `[x]`:

1. Run full validation suite:
   ```bash
   npx tsc --noEmit
   npm run build
   npx storybook build --quiet  # Stories must compile (UI epics only — skip for data-only epics)
   ```
2. Run self-tests (if config exists in `scripts/self-test-configs/`):
   ```bash
   node scripts/self-test.mjs --epic <epic-id>
   ```
   - **Exit code 0:** proceed to step 3
   - **Exit code 1:** structural failure — apply 3-strike rule (fix the failing check, re-run self-test)
   - **Warnings:** include in AUDIT_LOG.md under a "Visual Issues" section
   - **No config file for this epic:** skip this step (epics 0, 1, 11 have no self-tests)
3. If all pass:
   - Update `.ai-reports/AUDIT_LOG.md` with:
     - Date (run `date '+%Y-%m-%d'`)
     - Type: BUILD
     - Epic number and name
     - All tasks completed
     - Files created/modified (list them)
     - Any deviations from spec
   - Create summary git commit: `feat(epic-N): [epic description] — all tasks complete`
   - Output EXACTLY this (the runner script watches for it):
     ```
     <promise>EPIC N COMPLETE</promise>
     ```
3. If build fails: treat as a task failure, apply 3-strike rule to the build fix

### Blocked Exit

When you cannot proceed:

1. Mark current task `[!]` in MASTER_TODO.md with reason
2. Try remaining tasks in the epic (skip blocked ones)
3. When no more tasks can be attempted, output EXACTLY:
   ```
   <promise>EPIC N BLOCKED: [one-line reason]</promise>
   ```

### HARD STOPS (abort the entire loop immediately)

Output `<promise>EPIC N ABORTED: [reason]</promise>` if ANY of these occur:
- Self-test structural failure after 3 fix attempts
- Dev server won't start after 3 fix attempts
- Unresolvable dependency conflict (e.g., peer dep hell)
- Task requires output from a GATE epic not yet approved
- More than 5 structural TypeScript errors (not typos — architectural issues)
- Database connection fails and cannot be recovered
- You detect you're in an infinite loop (same error 3+ times)

### What NOT To Do

- Do NOT output `<promise>` until ALL tasks are verified
- Do NOT mark tasks `[x]` before validation passes
- Do NOT skip reading MASTER_TODO.md at the start — always check current state
- Do NOT retry the same failing approach more than 3 times
- Do NOT install packages not specified in the build plan without documenting why
- Do NOT modify `.env` — only `.env.example`
- Do NOT run `git push` — the runner script handles that after human review
- Do NOT skip writing stories for UI components — every component gets a co-located `.stories.tsx` file
- Do NOT use hardcoded mock data inline in stories — import from `src/__mocks__/cms-data.ts`
